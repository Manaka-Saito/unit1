# Project Unit 1: A simple calculator


# Citerion A: Planning

This section should be written in terms of "My client is suffering from, stated that his business is ... problem"
My client is suffering from leak of security information in his company. He needs stronger cybersecurity system for managing information.  

## Problem definition (Add more details to this context)



My client is the owner of a luxury hotel and manages his clients' information. Over the past 5 years, there have been 5 password attacks and other cyber attacks that have violated client privacy. My client's main concern is that employees use the website to access client information directly with password that is public within his company. To protect the company's credibility, my client want to ensure that the systems that allow access to client information are secure. In addition to this, his employees are complaining him the lack of the space to take memo for their works, and my client wants to solve this problem as well.()
- client can enter the spesific room number that turns into the password
- wants to keep the password hidden
- wants to use different password per employees


You've been hired by a cybersecurity company to design a simple too for their employees. notepad. However, this notepad has a secret function that is only revealed when a hidden code is entered. Once the correct secret code is typed into the memo, it transfroms into a basic password manager. 


## Proposed Solution

I am proposing, to create a notepad which contains a secret function that is only revealed when a hidden code is entered. Once the correct secret code is typed into the notepad, it transfroms into the password manager that my client requires. This is an adequate solution for my client because it solves the problem or keeping password information both protected and hidden.


## Success Criteria

1. The notepad should accept user input to perform basic operations (storing memo).
2. The notepad should give appropriate feedback.
3. If the user enters the secret code ("hello123"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.
4. In password manager mode, the user should be able to:
   - Add a password (for example, for a website).
   - View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code).
5. Save passwords permanently and securely.
6. Use the terminal to interact with the user.



Basic Tool Functionality:
Possible Options
   - Currency calculator
   - ToDo List
   - Time zone
   - Alarm 
   - Note pad
   - Guess a number
   - Calculator
   - Calender



Hidden Functionality:
1. If the user enters the secret code (ex. "open123"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.
2. In password manager mode, the user should be able to:
   - Add a password (ex. for a website)
   - View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code)
   - Optionally, display the passwords in a "masked" form (ex. showing only the first and last characters.)
3. Store passwords in a text file.
4. HL: Implement a basic obfuscation technique or basic encryption (ex. reversing the password string or shifting characters by a fixed number) User Interaction:
5. Use the terminal to interact with the user.
