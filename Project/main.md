# Project Unit 1: A simple calculator


# Citerion A: Planning

This section should be written in terms of "My client is suffering from, stated that his business is ... problem"


## Problem definition (Add more details to this context)

You've been hired by a cybersecurity company to design a simple too for their employees. [Describe the tool here]. However, this calculator has a secret function that is only revealed when a hidden code is entered. Once the correct secret code is typed into the calculator, it transfroms into a basic password manager. 


## Proposed Solution

I am proposing, to create a [simple tool] which contains a secret function that is only revealed when a hidden code is entered. Once the correct secret code is typed into the [simple tool], it transfroms into the password manager that my client requires. This is an adequate solution for my client because it solves the problem or keeping password information both protected and hidden.


## Success Criteria

Basic Tool Functionality:

Hidden Functionality:
1. If the user enters the secret code (ex. "open123"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.
2. In password manager mode, the user should be able to:
   - Add a password (ex. for a website)
   - View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code)
   - Optionally, display the passwords in a "masked" form (ex. showing only the first and last characters.)
3. Store passwords in a text file.
4. HL: Implement a basic obfuscation technique or basic encryption (ex. reversing the password string or shifting characters by a fixed number) User Interaction:
5. Use the terminal to interact with the user.
