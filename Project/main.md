# Project Unit 1: A simple calculator


# Citerion A: Planning

My client is suffering from leak of security information in his company. He needs stronger cybersecurity system for managing information.  


## Problem definition (Add more details to this context)

My client is the owner of luxury chain hotels and manages his clients’ information using each hotels’ websites. Over the past five years, there have been five phishing attacks and password attacks that violated client privacy. My client’s main concern is that employees use websites that can access all the passwords using a password that is open to everyone within the company. To protect the company’s credibility, my client wants to ensure that the system that allows access to client information is secure. (See the evidence of Consulation in the Appendix)

- client can enter the spesific room number that turns into the password
- wants to keep the password hidden
- wants to use different password per employees



## Proposed Solution

I am proposing to create a notepad which contains a secret function that is only revealed when a hidden code is entered. Once the correct secret code is typed into the notepad, it transfroms into the password manager that my client requires. This is an adequate solution for my client because it solves the problem or keeping password information both protected and hidden.


## Success Criteria

1. The notepad should accept user input to perform basic operations (adding memo, deleting memo and viewing memo).
   **[Issue Tackled]**: **: "employees use websites that can access all the passwords using a password that is open to everyone within the company."
   
2. The notepad should give appropriate feedback.

3. If the user enters the secret code (username"hotel"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager. [Issue Tackled]
4. In password manager mode, the user should be able to 

5. In password manager mode, the user should be able to:
   - Add a password (for example, for a website).
   - View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code).

6. Save passwords permanently and securely.

7. Use the terminal to interact with the user.



Basic Tool Functionality:
Possible Options
   - Currency calculator
   - ToDo List
   - Time zone
   - Alarm 
   - Note pad
   - Guess a number
   - Calculator
   - Calender



Hidden Functionality:
1. If the user enters the secret code (ex. "open123"), the program will change modes and act as a password manager.
2. In password manager mode, the user should be able to:
   - Add a password (ex. for a website)
   - View the stored passwords (only if they re-enter the secret code)
   - Optionally, display the passwords in a "masked" form (ex. showing only the first and last characters.)
3. Store passwords in a text file.
4. HL: Implement a basic obfuscation technique or basic encryption (ex. reversing the password string or shifting characters by a fixed number) User Interaction:
5. Use the terminal to interact with the user.
